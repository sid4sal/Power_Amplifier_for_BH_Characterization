# Design and Implementation of High Bandwidth Power Amplifier for B-H Characterization of Magnetic Materials

## Project Overview

The High Bandwidth Power Amplifier is a device for magnetic materials engineers to obtain B-H characterization of magnetic materials at low as well as high frequencies. It is a transformer-less multi-stage direct-coupled linear power amplifier for the characterization of magnetic cores at various frequencies.

The amplifier operates from 50 Hz to 250 kHz with a gain of approximately 4.6 (13.2 dB). It can handle an input power voltage up to Â±60 V, allowing the reference signal to be given up to 12-13 V. The current rating of the amplifier is up to 2.5-3 A (continuous).

The user manual and all the required files can be found at this repo.
